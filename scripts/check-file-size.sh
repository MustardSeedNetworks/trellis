#!/bin/bash
# scripts/check-file-size.sh
# One size limit per file type, enforced. Part of CI quality gates.
#
# A file over its limit fails the build unless scripts/file-size-baseline.txt
# grants it an accepted maximum, and a granted file may not grow past it. That
# is the whole rule: debt is explicit, reviewed, and shrink-only.
#
# There used to be two tiers -- an advisory warning at 600 Go / 400 TS lines
# and a failing "red flag" at 1200 / 800. The warning tier changed nothing
# between January and September 2026: it printed on every run, blocked nothing,
# and trained everyone to scroll past it. A gate that cannot fail is not a
# gate, so the advisory tier is gone and the enforced limit moved to where the
# warning used to be pointing (900 Go / 600 TS) rather than staying at a
# number nobody would ever hit deliberately.
