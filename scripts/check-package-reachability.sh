# Fails when an internal package is reachable from no binary.
#
# staticcheck's unused checks (U1000 and friends) cannot answer this. They find
# unused identifiers *within* a package that is being compiled; a package
# nobody imports still looks fully used from inside its own tests. That gap is
# not theoretical — stem carried 2,800 lines across two packages that no binary
# reached, past a weekly dead-code job that reported success every time.
#
# `go list -deps` over every main package answers it directly, in a second.
#
# Packages already unreachable when this gate was adopted are recorded in
# scripts/package-reachability-baseline.txt with a note. They are debt, not
# permission: the list may shrink and must not grow.
