"""Report a bundle's Location Services authorization.

Reading /var/db/locationd/clients.plist with grep or an awk range is
unreliable: client keys are long composites of user UUID and a mangled
identifier, several entries share prefixes, and a range like
``/pattern/,/^  }/`` silently reports a neighbouring block. That produced wrong
answers more than once during the macOS Wi-Fi work.

``plutil -convert json`` is not an option either — the plist stores binary
client tokens, which JSON cannot represent. plistlib reads it directly.

Exit status: 0 authorized, 1 registered but not authorized, 2 unknown to
locationd, so this can gate a script rather than only inform a human.
